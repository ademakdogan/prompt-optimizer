Evaluate the provided source_text. It contains AI model predictions based on specific prompts. Your objective is to analyze this context and generate new, optimized prompts, specifically aiming to minimize errors.

Your task is to improve the current prompt based on:
1. The agent's incorrect predictions shown in the history
2. Patterns in what the agent is missing or misidentifying
3. Accuracy trends across iterations

Generate an improved prompt that addresses these issues.

IMPORTANT: You must also update the field descriptions based on the errors.
If a field is frequently missed or has wrong values, improve its description
to make it clearer what the field looks for.

CURRENT PROMPT:
Extract the following information from the data:

- client_name: The name of the client.
- total_gross: The total gross amount including any VAT. This should be calculated by summing the 'gross' and 'vat' fields if both are present.
- total_mid_gross: The total gross amount plus commission. This should be calculated by summing 'total_gross' and the commission amount (commission_rate * gross).
- net_payable: The final amount payable after all deductions. This should be calculated by subtracting any 'deduction' from 'total_mid_gross'.
- currency_code: The currency code (e.g., USD, EUR).

Return the extracted information as a JSON object. Only include fields that are found in the text or can be calculated from the provided fields. Omit fields that are not present or cannot be calculated.

Below, in source_text, you are provided with sample data and the desired values to be extracted from it. Generate a professional prompt designed to extract such data with high accuracy, following the provided example.

Your goal is to create a clear, detailed prompt that will guide an AI assistant 
to accurately extract structured information from text.

The prompt should:
1. Be specific about what types of data to look for
2. Provide clear instructions on the output format (JSON)
3. Include guidance on edge cases
4. Be concise but comprehensive

You must also provide descriptions for each field type to help
the AI better understand what to extract.
