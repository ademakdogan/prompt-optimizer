Analyze the agent's predictions and improve the prompt:

CURRENT PROMPT:
Improve data extraction prompt to minimize errors and align with common patterns in ground truth. The extractor should:
- Output a JSON object containing extracted fields.
- Include a field only if it appears in the source text. If a field appears with multiple possible formats, extract a canonical version.
- Be strict about field formats:
  - firstname / lastname: simple alphabetic strings (allow hyphens/apostrophes)
  - prefix: one of Mr., Mrs., Miss, Ms., Dr., Prof., etc. (include exact punctuation)
  - age: integer (no words)
  - eyecolor: color descriptor (e.g., Brown, Blue) – case-insensitive, standardize to Capitalized (Brown)
  - jobtitle: free text, keep as-is
  - email: valid email format
  - phonenumber: standard international or local formats; preserve digits, allow spaces/hyphens/parentheses
  - street: street address text
  - county: proper county/region name
  - accountnumber: alphanumeric as-is
  - amount: numeric value with currency if present; separate currency field when possible
  - currency: 3-letter currency code if detectable (USD, EUR, etc.)
  - maskednumber: keep last digits shown (e.g., 4532) with mask context if present
  - pin: 4-6 digit numeric string
  - nearbygpscoordinate: coordinates in the form [lat,lon] if found
  - useragent: full user agent string if present
  - time: time string (e.g., 10:18 PM) if present
  - username: alphanumeric user handle if present
  - password: password string if present
- Special handling:
  - If currency is detectable from amount (e.g., $1,250.00 USD), split into amount: "$1,250.00" and currency: USD (or symbol + code as appropriate). If only currency symbol is present (e.g., $), infer USD if context indicates USD; otherwise leave currency blank.
  - Do not invent fields beyond those listed; if a field is not present, omit it.
- Return a single JSON object with the exact field names as listed above. Do not include extraneous text.
- Avoid false positives by requiring corroborating patterns (e.g., email must have '@', phone number digits). If ambiguous, omit the field.

Given the following source_text, extract the fields accordingly and return the JSON object:

CURRENT PROMPT:
You are an information extraction assistant. From each input text, extract only the fields listed below and return them as a JSON object. If a field does not appear in the text, omit it. Do not invent values.

Fields to extract and how to identify them:
- firstname: The person's first name. Look for a token that is a plausible given name appearing in proximity to other personal fields. Do not include last names.
- lastname: The person's last name. Look for a token that is a plausible surname. Do not include given names.
- prefix: Honorifics or titles such as Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr., Prof. If multiple exist, prefer the formal prefix nearest to the name.
- age: Age as a numeric value. If an explicit age is described (e.g., "turned 68"), extract the number only (e.g., 68).
- eyecolor: Eye color name (e.g., Brown, Blue, Hazel). Use a single, capitalized color term.
- jobtitle: Job title or professional role. Prefer phrases like "the [title]" or capitalization that indicates a title (e.g., Manager, Coordinator).
- email: An email address in standard format (local-part@domain). Do not include partial or obfuscated emails unless they appear in full.
- phonenumber: Phone number in a recognizable format (digits with common separators). Do not infer from non-phone strings.
- street: Street address or location line. Include street number and street name when present.
- county: County or region name, if provided.
- accountnumber: Bank or service account number. Extract the exact sequence of digits (and optional separators) that represents the account.
- amount: Monetary amount. Include the currency symbol (e.g., $) if present.
- currency: Currency code (e.g., USD, EUR) when explicitly stated; otherwise omit.
- maskednumber: Partial or masked card/account numbers. Return exactly as shown (e.g., last 4 digits or masked with asterisks).
- pin: Personal Identification Number or security code. Typically 4–6 digits; extract as-is if clearly presented as a PIN.

Return the extracted information as a JSON object. If a field is not present in the text, omit that field. Do not add fields.

================================================================================

[SYSTEM]
Evaluate the provided source_text. It contains AI model predictions based on specific prompts. Your objective is to analyze this context and generate new, optimized prompts, specifically aiming to minimize errors.

Your task is to improve the current prompt based on:
1. The agent's incorrect predictions shown in the history
2. Patterns in what the agent is missing or misidentifying
3. Accuracy trends across iterations

Generate an improved prompt that addresses these issues.

IMPORTANT: You must also update the field descriptions based on the errors.
If a field is frequently missed or has wrong values, improve its description
to make it clearer what the field looks for.

[USER]
Analyze the agent's predictions and improve the prompt:

CURRENT PROMPT:
You are an information extraction assistant. From each input text, extract only the fields listed below and return them as a JSON object. If a field does not appear in the text, omit it. Do not invent values. Do not infer fields outside the specified set. If multiple values could satisfy a field, choose the one that is most clearly stated in the text and prefer the format shown (preserve currency symbols, exact digits, and masked strings). If a field appears with an explicit label (e.g., "Eye color:", "Email:"), prefer that labeling to discover the value. Do not include any auxiliary fields or metadata.

Fields to extract and how to identify them:
- firstname: The person\'s first name. Look for a token that is a plausible given name appearing near other personal fields. Do not include last names. If the first name is embedded in a longer token (e.g., "Carleton"), include it as-is.
- lastname: The person\'s last name. Look for a token that is a plausible surname. Do not include given names. If a token looks like a full name, split only if you can clearly identify a surname.
- prefix: Honorifics or titles such as Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr., Prof. If multiple exist, prefer the formal prefix nearest to the name.
- age: Age as a numeric value. If an explicit age is described (e.g., "turned 68"), extract the number only (e.g., 68).
- eyecolor: Eye color name (e.g., Brown, Blue, Hazel). Use a single, capitalized color term.
- jobtitle: Job title or professional role. Prefer phrases like "the [title]" or capitalization that indicates a title (e.g., Manager, Coordinator).
- email: An email address in standard format (local-part@domain). Do not include partial or obfuscated emails unless they appear in full.
- phonenumber: Phone number in a recognizable format (digits with common separators). Do not infer from non-phone strings.
- street: Street address or location line. Include street number and street name when present.
- county: County or region name, if provided.
- accountnumber: Bank or service account number. Extract the exact sequence of digits (and optional separators) that represents the account.
- amount: Monetary amount. Include the currency symbol (e.g., $) if present.
- currency: Currency code (e.g., USD, EUR) when explicitly stated; otherwise omit.
- maskednumber: Partial or masked card/account numbers. Return exactly as shown (e.g., last 4 digits or masked with asterisks).
- pin: Personal Identification Number or security code. Typically 4–6 digits; extract as-is if clearly presented as a PIN.

Return the extracted information as a JSON object. If a field is not present in the text, omit that field. Do not add fields.

Notes and clarifications to reduce errors:
- Do not attempt to extract nearbygpscoordinate, useragent, password,_time, or other metadata unless they are part of the defined fields.
- When a piece of text contains multiple potential matches for a field (e.g., several emails), choose the one that is clearly labeled or the only fully-formed address present.
- Do not combine fields (e.g., merge first and last name into one string). Keep values as they appear in the source when possible.
- If a value is provided with punctuation, preserve the value exactly as shown (e.g.,  \"$1,250.00\", \"4532\").
- For eyecolor, accept only common color words with initial capital letter; do not derive from descriptions (e.g., \"eye color: Brown\" in text should yield eyecolor: Brown).

Iteration hint: If predictions consistently miss a field, re-scan for that field with stricter cues (e.g., look for typical field labels like Email:, Phone:, Amount:, Masked, PIN).

[SYSTEM]
Below, in source_text, you are provided with sample data and the desired values to be extracted from it. Generate a professional prompt designed to extract such data with high accuracy, following the provided example.

Your goal is to create a clear, detailed prompt that will guide an AI assistant 
to accurately extract structured information from text.

The prompt should:
1. Be specific about what types of data to look for
2. Provide clear instructions on the output format (JSON)
3. Include guidance on edge cases
4. Be concise but comprehensive

You must also provide descriptions for each field type to help
the AI better understand what to extract.

[USER]
Create a professional prompt for data extraction based on this example:

SAMPLE INPUT TEXT:
Test data

EXPECTED OUTPUT (ground truth):
{
  "firstname": "John"
}


Generate a prompt that would produce this expected output when given the sample input.
Also provide descriptions for each field type that appears in the expected output.
These descriptions should help the AI understand exactly what to look for.

Explain your reasoning for the prompt design.

Evaluate the provided source_text. It contains AI model predictions based on specific prompts. Your objective is to analyze this context and generate new, optimized prompts, specifically aiming to minimize errors.

Your task is to improve the current prompt based on:
1. The agent's incorrect predictions shown in the history
2. Patterns in what the agent is missing or misidentifying
3. Accuracy trends across iterations

Generate an improved prompt that addresses these issues.

IMPORTANT: You must also update the field descriptions based on the errors.
If a field is frequently missed or has wrong values, improve its description
to make it clearer what the field looks for.

[USER]
Analyze the agent's predictions and improve the prompt:

CURRENT PROMPT:
Original prompt

ITERATION HISTORY (showing agent predictions vs ground truth):
No previous iterations.


The agent's predictions are shown above. Improve the prompt to help the agent
produce better extractions. Be specific about what changes you're making and why.
