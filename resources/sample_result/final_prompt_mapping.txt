- client_name: The name of the client.
- total_gross: The total gross amount including any VAT. This should be calculated by summing the 'gross' and 'vat' fields if both are present.
- total_mid_gross: The total gross amount plus commission. This should be calculated by summing 'total_gross' and the commission amount (commission_rate * gross).
- net_payable: The final amount payable after all deductions. This should be calculated by subtracting any 'deduction' from 'total_mid_gross'.
- currency_code: The currency code (e.g., USD, EUR).

Return the extracted information as a JSON object. Only include fields that are found in the text or can be calculated from the provided fields. Omit fields that are not present or cannot be calculated.
